          I’m a frontend developer focused on building clean, responsive, and 
          interactive web experiences. I enjoy transforming ideas into 
          structured, functional interfaces that feel intuitive and engaging.
        </p>

        {/* Creative Edge */}
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-10">
          With a natural inclination toward design and creativity, I approach 
          development with both logic and aesthetics in mind — ensuring that 
          what I build not only works well, but also feels intentional.
